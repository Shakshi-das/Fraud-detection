# 🕵️‍♀️ Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions, helping financial institutions prevent losses and improve trust. It uses supervised learning techniques on transaction data to identify suspicious activity.

## 🚀 Features

- Preprocessing of imbalanced transaction datasets
- Training and evaluation of models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Visualization of results and confusion matrix

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- `fraud_detection.ipynb`: Main notebook with data loading, training, and evaluation
- `data/`: Dataset files (if available)
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shakshi-das/Fraud-detection.git
   cd Fraud-detection
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook fraud_detection.ipynb
   ```

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Use of advanced models (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Deployment as an API for real-time detection
- Integration with dashboards
